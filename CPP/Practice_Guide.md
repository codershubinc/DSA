# DSA Practice Guide

This directory contains practice problems organized by the phases outlined in the [DSA Roadmap](../DSA_Roadmap.md).

## Structure

Each phase has its own directory containing C++ files for key problems.

- **Phase 1:** Fundamentals (Language basics, Time Complexity)
- **Phase 2:** Basic Data Structures (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists)
- **Phase 3:** Essential Algorithms (Recursion, Sorting, Searching)
- **Phase 4:** Intermediate Data Structures (Stacks, Queues, Hashing)
- **Phase 5:** Non-Linear Data Structures (Trees, Heaps)
- **Phase 6:** Advanced Data Structures (Graphs, Tries)
- **Phase 7:** Advanced Algorithms (DP, Greedy, Backtracking)
- **Phase 8:** System Design Concepts

## File Format

Each C++ file follows this structure:

1.  **Header Comments:**
    - Problem Description
    - Explanation of the approach
    - Time & Space Complexity analysis
    - **Q&A Section:** Common interview questions or doubts related to the problem.
2.  **Code:** Standard C++ solution using STL.
3.  **Main Function:** Test cases to verify the solution.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the phase you are studying.
2.  Open a problem file (e.g., `Phase2_Basic_Data_Structures/1_Reverse_Array.cpp`).
3.  Read the problem and try to solve it yourself first.
4.  Read the explanation and Q&A to deepen your understanding.
5.  Run the code to see it in action.
